## What is Pomodoro Techniqe?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student

## How the script work?

- Just like the traditional method, launching the script initiates a Pomodoro timer for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break.

- You take a 20-minute break following the fourth round, marking the end of the session.

- Then you will be asked  if you want to keep going every four sessions; if not, you will be asked to write a brief summary of the sessions.
